/**

 * @author Stephen Collins, Vanessa Harris, Kolter Bradshaw, Cristhian Ramirez
 * (Date: 4/24/2013) 
 * Purpose: Defines the JFrame used as a top-level container by this program and instantiates that JFrame.
 * in a main method, initiating the application.  A single JPanel, with a GridLayout(1,1), is added to this
 * JFrame to provide a top-level border for the application.  SystemInit is interacted with by the LogInGUI,
 * TransactionGUI and AdministratorGUI classes.  These classes invoke static methods in SystemInit to change
 * screens by removing all components from the JPanel and instantiating a new object of the class which
 * the application needs to switch to, directed by user input.
 * 
 * The application is organized in a modular fashion with this class functioning as the top-level container, and
 * the LoginGUI, TransactionGUI and AdministratorGUI classes functioning as the main user interfaces which are
 * swapped out as necessary.  Those classes are extensions of JPanel and are themselves made up of other classes
 * which are extensions of JPanels, allowing each class to be inserted into another class further up the 
 * hierarchy to form the complete the screen.
